<p>
  Hi, I’m <strong>Suryadevara Pavan</strong>, a B.Tech student in Information Technology with a strong interest in 
  web development and cybersecurity. I enjoy building practical applications and experimenting with 
  different technologies to solve real-world problems.
</p>
<p>
  As a Web Developer Intern at <strong>Prodigy Infotech</strong>, I created four responsive projects — a landing page, 
  a mini-game, a portfolio website, and a form validation app — all built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  I also developed <strong>Rainbow Dragon</strong>, a multi-threaded web scraper that automates the download of files (like images, PDFs, and GIFs) from a given URL based on file type. It uses Python, BeautifulSoup, and `concurrent.futures` for efficient parallel scraping, along with session handling and dynamic file naming for robustness.
</p>
<p>
  In cybersecurity, I trained at <strong>Skill Dzire</strong>, where I conducted simulated network attacks and built 
  a custom toolkit combining a Go-based concurrent port scanner with a Python tool for IP and network 
  reconnaissance. I often test these in my homelab with multiple virtual machines.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve solved 100+ problems on LeetCode, earned certifications in threat intelligence and generative AI, 
  and I mainly work with Python and JavaScript. Whether on Linux or Windows, I enjoy coding tools, 
  experimenting with new frameworks, and making every project both functional and impactful.
